AlfredLite is a lightweight modular framework for creating 
[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflows. It has zero (required) external
dependencies, and only loads the bare minimum functionality by default. The
modular nature of the system gives the developer the flexability to load only
what they require, which keeps load times fast.
